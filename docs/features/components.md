# Component builder

The **Component** view (the `C` tab) is where you author the reusable *building
blocks* of a model. It is deliberately separate from the **Value chain** view:

- **Component view** = the *details* of each building block — recipes, streams,
  abatement measures. The "what things are."
- **Value chain view** = how building blocks *connect* — the structure and the
  commodity flows between them. The "how things are wired."

A component **library** is a named, self-contained catalogue of these blocks. The
left rail lists every library; inside, content is organised **by sector**, and
each sector holds the three fixed structures:

```
<library>  (· base or · scenario)
└── <sector>            e.g. steel, power, hydrogen … (Other = unclassified)
    ├── Technology      recipes whose product is in this sector
    ├── Stream          the OUTPUTS this sector produces (see below)
    └── Measures & MACC
        ├── MACC         a named bundle of measures (with a MACC curve)
        └── Individual   the reusable measures themselves
```

Right-click any node for add / rename / delete; edits autosave to the library.
A brand-new item is unclassified until it has an output / link, so it appears
under **Other** until you wire it up.

> **Note.** There is no separate "Components" section. A composite unit *is* a
> technology placed as a machine in the Value-chain view, so the old Components
> list duplicated Technology and was removed — the builder is **technology-only**.

## Technology

A technology is a recipe. It carries:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `technology_id` | unique recipe id |
| `lifespan` | asset life in years (drives renewal scheduling) |
| `capex` | replacement capital cost, per unit capacity |
| `opex` | operating cost, per unit throughput |
| `introduction_year` / `phase_out_year` | the years the technology is **available** to adopt (blank = always); the optimiser only runs / switches to it within this window |
| `io` | the input / output / impact rows (see below) |
| `maccs` | the MACCs that apply to this technology |

Each **io** row is `{target, role, coefficient, …}`:

- `role: "input"` — consumes `coefficient` units of the `target` stream per unit
  throughput. Optional `group` + `share_min/share_max` make it a **blend group**
  (the optimiser picks the mix within bounds — e.g. coal/gas/H₂ fuel switching).
- `role: "output"` — produces `coefficient` units; `is_product: true` marks a
  final deliverable (demand can be placed against it).
- `role: "impact"` — emits `coefficient` units of an impact (e.g. `CO2`) per unit
  throughput.

## Stream (commodities) — grouped by owning sector

A stream is a commodity that technologies consume or produce:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `commodity_id` | unique stream id |
| `kind` | `energy` · `material` · `indirect` · `product` · `byproduct` |
| `unit` | display unit (`t`, `MWh`, `GJ`, …) |
| `price` | external purchase price (blank ⇒ not buyable, must be produced) |
| `sale_price` | external sale price for surplus |
| `sector` | **owning sector** — see below |

### What "sector" means (Stream = outputs)

A stream belongs to the sector that **produces** it, not the one that consumes
it. Electricity is a **power** stream even though steel mills consume it — it is
*from* the power sector. So a library shows under each sector only the streams
that sector's technologies **output**:

- the **Steel** sector's streams are `iron`, `steel` (what it produces) — *not*
  `electricity` or `coal`, which are inputs produced elsewhere and so don't
  appear in the Steel library at all;
- the **Power** sector's streams are `electricity`, `steam`.

A commodity's `sector` field declares its owning sector (set in the stream
editor). A produced stream with no sector, or a just-added standalone stream,
falls under **Other** until classified. Sector is purely organisational — the
optimiser ignores it, so re-classifying never changes a result.

## Measures & MACC

A **measure** is a retrofit/abatement lever:

- `type: "energy_efficiency"` → `target` is a *stream*; the measure reduces
  consumption of that stream.
- `type: "emission_reduction"` (or `environmental`) → `target` is an *impact*
  (e.g. `CO2`); the measure reduces that impact directly.
- `blocks` is the stepwise curve: each block has a `reduction` fraction and a
  `capex_per_capacity` (+ optional `opex_per_capacity`), adopted cheapest-first.

A **MACC** bundles measures by id. A technology lists the MACCs that apply to it;
placing that technology stamps every measure of those MACCs onto the resulting
machine, with block costs scaled to the machine's capacity. Selecting a MACC
shows its **marginal-abatement-cost curve** — one bar per block, width ∝ the
reduction it delivers and height ∝ its marginal cost (capex ÷ reduction), sorted
cheapest-first, with no-regret (negative-cost) blocks below the axis.

## Where libraries live

- **Base / bundled libraries** ship with pathwise (`assets/component_libraries/`)
  and seed a writable copy on first run; they are the shared, reusable catalogue.
- **Per-session libraries** — each imported scenario carries its own component
  library, loaded alongside the base set, so a scenario's specific recipes don't
  pollute the shared catalogue. This is fully implemented (backed by
  `SessionLibraryStore`; see `api/routers/component_libraries.py`).

The Component view lists both sets, each tagged in the tree — `· scenario` for the
session set, `· base` for the shared set.

See [scenarios.md](scenarios.md) for how an imported scenario routes its component
*details* here and its value-chain *structure* to the Value-chain view.

## MachineComponent and GroupComponent

`MachineComponent` and `GroupComponent` are legacy composite types defined in
`data/components.py` and kept for backward compatibility with older library files.
The current builder does **not** author them — instead, technologies are placed
directly as machine nodes in the Value-chain view. A `ComponentLibrary` may still
carry `machines` and `groups` fields when loaded from an old file; the engine
handles them, but the UI does not expose them for creation.
